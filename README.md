# Data Wrangling with âœ¨ PySpark âœ¨

Revised PySpark after a while with the help of a nifty [cheatsheet](https://amandeepsinghkhanna.github.io/data-wrangling-with-pyspark/)!
I've included the set-up that was required to run pyspark on Google Collab as well.
The dataset used is the airports.csv file.

All the best for your learning and revision!! ðŸ˜„
